# EE551FinalProject

## Introduction:

This is my final project for EE551 using Python.
Author: Joseph Kuhn

## Purposals:

The goal of this project is to recreate the classic game of Tetris. The game is made up of a play area where blocks fall down from the top. The player can control where the blocks fall and can also rotate the blocks to try to fit them better. By filling up a straight row with blocks, the player received points and the blocks disappear. The game ends if a block is placed that goes above the ceiling of the play area, so the goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible.

## How to play:

The player begins the game by pressing the space bar, as prompted. The player then controls one block at a time, whichever block is currently falling on the screen. The upcoming two blocks are shown on the right side of the screen. The score is shown on the left side of the screen. The player's objective is to fill up rows with blocks so that the rows clear and the player receives points. Clearing one row at a time gives the player 10 points; clearing two gives 30; clearing three gives 60; and clearing four at once gives 100 points. The goal is to play for as long as you can and achieve as high of a score as you can. The blocks will progressively begin to fall faster, so the game becomes harder the longer it goes on. Once a block reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.

The player controls the blocks with the up, down, left, and right keys. The left and right keys move the piece left and right, respectively. The down key moves the piece down a little quicker. The up key rotates the piece to change its orientation, allowing for more strategy.

## Future features:

* Difficulty settings
[] High scores page
[] Music options
[] Slightly improved functionality (such as holding a key down to move a piece repeatedly)
