Author: Joseph Kuhn

## Purposals:

The goal of this project is to recreate the classic game of Tetris. The game is made up of a play area where blocks fall down from the top. The player can control where the blocks fall and can also rotate the blocks to try to fit them better. By filling up a straight row with blocks, the player received points and the blocks disappear. The game ends if a block is placed that goes above the ceiling of the play area, so the goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible.

## TODO:

- [ ] Gather images for the play area and blocks
- [ ] Set up text and HUD such as score and upcoming block
- [ ] Program blocks to fall at a steady pace
- [ ] Allow user to control falling blocks by moving and rotating them with inputs
- [ ] Randomize order of falling blocks
- [ ] Program the blocks to disappear and increase score if a row is filled
- [ ] End the game if a block goes past the ceiling
